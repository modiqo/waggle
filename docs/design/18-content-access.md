# 18 — Content Access: the token as a file descriptor

*New in revision 2.6. Closes the surgical-access gap: `query` slices a
token's metadata document; nothing sliced its **content**. Consumers had
to fetch whole artifacts (or grep a local path outside waggle — invisible
to attribution, impossible across machines). This doc adds `read` and
`search`: grep/sed semantics through the reference itself.*

## 1 · The principle

A waggle token names an artifact. With `read`/`search` it also **answers
questions about the artifact's content** — under the same discipline as
`query`: hard byte budgets, responses that name the bytes they spared
you, executable `next` guidance, errors that name the fix.

The one-sentence version: *the token tells you where the coat is;
`read`/`search` reach into its pocket without taking the coat.*

## 2 · The lens stack

Formats are not special-cased; they select **lenses**. Every text
artifact gets lens 0; content type adds lens 1. Lenses are discoverable
(the `read` overview lists them), never guessed.

| Lens | Applies to | Addressing |
|---|---|---|
| **0 · lines + search** | any text (`text/*`, json, yaml, code, csv, logs) | `lines: "A-B"`, regex `pattern` |
| **1 · outline/section** | `text/markdown` | `path: "/outline"`, `section: "<heading>"` |
| **1 · pointer** | `application/json` | `path: "/deps/react/version"` — **reuses the CP-7 `slice_at` engine on parsed content** |
| media | binary (`image/*`, `audio/*`, docx, pdf) | not line-addressable: `MediaRef` fetch (exists); extract-at-mint variant makes them sliceable |

Explicit v1 boundaries (recorded, not hidden): YAML gets lens 0 only
(no maintained serde-yaml — parser choice deferred); code symbols
(tree-sitter) deferred — `search "fn resolve"` + `read` window covers
the loop at zero dependency cost; docx/pdf extraction is author-side.

## 3 · Where the bytes come from (and `mint --snapshot`)

Resolution order, deterministic:

1. **`manifest.content`** — a new **immutable-core** field:
   `Option<MediaRef>`, set only at mint. `mint --snapshot` reads the
   target, stores it content-addressed in the blob CAS, and pins the
   `MediaRef`. This is the load-bearing addition: the searched content is
   **immutable by hash** (what you grep is what was minted), and it
   travels wherever blobs replicate — search works on machines where the
   file never existed (the 0.2 edge story).
2. **The target**, when it is a locally readable `file://` path — the
   daemon reads it fresh (mutable artifacts: you search the file as it is
   now; the doc says so).
3. Neither → the error names the fix: *"no readable content behind this
   token — mint with --snapshot or --attach"*.

Size cap: 16 MB per read (hint: split or snapshot a subset). Text rule:
content types `text/*`, `application/json`, `application/yaml` slice;
anything else is binary → media path, with the extract-at-mint hint.

## 4 · The operations

**`read`** — token (req); one of `lines: "A-B"` · `section: "<heading>"` ·
`path: "<pointer>"`; `max-bytes` (default 4096, floor 64). With no
address: the **overview** — total lines/bytes, content type, available
lenses, and (markdown) the outline with line numbers or (json) the root
shape. Windows clamp to the budget and report the range actually
returned; `next` continues the window.

**`search`** — token (req), `pattern` (regex, req), `context` (lines,
default 2), `max-matches` (default 5, cap 50), `max-bytes`. Returns
matches `{line, text, before, after}`, **`total_matches` counted in
full** even when truncated, and `next` chains the first match into a
`read` window — the grep→open loop, through the reference.

Map edges: `resolve → search` ("interrogate before ingesting"),
`search → read`, `read → read` (continue). Both ops: catalog + CLI +
MCP, parity-guarded like everything else.

## 5 · Attribution and I-1

Every `read`/`search` records the new well-known stage **`read`** —
a count with actor class. **Never the pattern, never the matched text,
never the ranges** (I-1 unchanged: no payload field exists). Authors
learn "searched 14× before anyone ran" — content stays dark to the log.

## 6 · Capability note

*The remote form of everything in this doc is governed by the
computation-travels-to-the-data contract — doc `08 §0`: the caller never
learns where the bytes are and only ever receives budgeted answers.*

Locally the daemon already runs as the user; a token adds no privilege.
Remotely (token-gated TCP, edge) a token becomes a **read capability**
for its content — scoped to `manifest.content` blobs (never live
filesystem reads for remote callers), governed by CP-11 signing.

## 7 · The format boundary: who decodes PDF, docx, images, voice

**Waggle does not decode formats. Ever.** The boundary is principled,
not provisional, and it is division of labor — not delegation:

- **Extraction is the harness's job, once, at mint.** The minting agent
  is multimodal — it reads PDFs and images natively, better than any
  bundled Rust extractor will (tables, layout, scans, accents). It
  extracts with its own abilities and passes the text to waggle.
- **Persistence, integrity, serving, and attribution of that extraction
  are waggle's job, forever.** `mint --content <extracted.txt>` stores
  the extraction content-addressed and pins it as `manifest.content`;
  every downstream consumer gets budgeted `read`/`search` against it, on
  any machine, with `read`-stage receipts.

Why not bundle extractors (rejected explicitly): a format treadmill
(pdf, docx, pptx, epub, HEIC, …), mediocre quality exactly where it
matters, binary bloat against the plumbing ethos — and it duplicates a
capability the models improve at without us shipping a byte.

Why not leave it wholly to consumers (rejected explicitly): N consumers
× M machines re-reading a 60-page PDF with vision calls is the
token-waste problem in its most expensive form. **Extract once at
check-in; search forever.**

The three mint shapes, spelled out:

| Artifact | Call | `manifest.content` | Variants |
|---|---|---|---|
| text file | `mint --snapshot` | the target's own bytes | catch-all |
| PDF/docx | `mint --content extracted.txt` (harness extracted it) | the extraction | `--attach` the original for vision/human consumers |
| voice memo | `mint --content transcript.txt --attach memo.m4a` | the transcript | audio `MediaRef` for listeners |

`--snapshot` and `--content` are mutually exclusive (both claim
`manifest.content`); passing both is refused with the distinction named.
The agent-stub instruction (17, one added sentence): *"when minting a
binary artifact, extract its text with your own abilities and pass it
via content."* Every multimodal harness becomes an extraction worker for
the network — for free.

Roadmap here (small, format-agnostic): byte-range reads on `MediaRef`
blobs (audio segments, resumable pulls — ranges, never decoding).

## 8 · Gates (CP-7.5)

- lens-0 unit suite: window clamping, 1-based inclusive ranges, regex
  matching with context, `total_matches` honesty under truncation,
  budget property (no response exceeds `max-bytes`, randomized);
- lens-1: markdown outline/section extraction; JSON pointer ≡ `slice_at`
  on parsed content (delegation test);
- integration: mint a real file → search → read-the-match window over
  dispatch; **the binary story**: mint a PDF-shaped target with
  `--content extracted.txt` → search hits the extraction while the
  target stays binary; `--snapshot`+`--content` together refused; **snapshot immortality** (mint --snapshot, delete the file,
  search still answers from the CAS, hash-verified); binary refusal with
  hint; funnel shows `read` counts; `envelope_next_valid` over every
  response;
- catalog: parity + reachability green with `read`/`search`; COMMANDS.md
  regenerated; tutorial (guide 07) written from live transcripts.

## 9 · The directory affordances (added; see doc 22 §4)

A token may name a **folder** (`mint --tree`: one parent, every file a child).
These three affordances were not designed at a whiteboard — each exists
because the cross-modality benchmark caught an agent needing it and not
having it, and the traces name the failure exactly.

### 9.1 Describe (`read` on a tree)

`search` had always grepped a tree. `read` answered **null**. So a folder
could be searched and never *described* — and the first move every agent
makes with a shared directory is to ask what is in it. Both models we traced
opened with an overview call and received 83 bytes of nulls, then had to
guess a regex blind; one guessed wrong and got zero matches.

`read` on a tree now returns **the tree**: each file, its own token, size,
content type, and outline. The folder's table of contents. Listing is *not*
consumption — no `read` stage is stamped for the children, because a table of
contents tells you what exists and does not serve you the bytes.

### 9.2 Lens (`read --section/--symbol/--lines` on a tree)

A tree could be grepped but not *lensed*. We watched an agent issue
`section: "Retry Policy"` **ten times**, once per child token — hand-rolling
a fan-out the substrate should perform in one call. A lens on the folder
token now answers for **every file at once** (13 ops → 3; 11k tokens → 4.5k).
Unlike the listing, this *serves bytes*, so every file it answers for is
stamped read: the receipt records what the consumer actually got.

### 9.3 Finish (`complete` / `examined` / `total_files` / `--from`)

And that fan-out promptly produced a **confident wrong answer**. It exhausted
its budget after nine of ten runbooks; the missing one was the one that
mattered; the agent reasoned over a partial folder and answered with
conviction. **A truncated fan-out that reads like a whole one is worse than a
slow one.** The response now carries `total_files`, `examined`, and
`complete`, and when it is short it returns a `from` cursor and a `next` that
says INCOMPLETE in words. Given that, the same agent resumes and gets it
right.

The rule the three share is the one this document has argued from the start,
now stated for trees: **a projection must never be a dead end, and it must
never pretend to be whole when it is not.**
